# Code challenge - Frontend

## Intro

An imaginary client has tasked us to build an app where their customers are able to search for movies, see details for a given movie, favorite that movie, see all favorited movies.

The app will mainly use themoviedb.org's API and will put the media front and center for the user.

## Steps to implement

1) Make an API key following the steps here: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction
2) Film search (using this API endpoint **GET** https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie?api_key={apikey}&query=<search_query>), display the films in whatever UI you want.
3) The user should be able to see details of the film (endpoint **GET** https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/{movie_id}?api_key={apikey})
4) The user should be able to favorite and unfavorite a movie (use whatever local storage that you think make sense)
5) The user should be able to see a list of favorite movies (and from there go to the detail movie screen)

## Tips

- Spend some time on transitions/animations and the small tweaks that make an app _nice to use_
- Focus on good naming
- If you end up with complex code, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, document the thoughts behind it

## Before you start

You can use any frameworks and/or architecture you like, any UI, make as many or little comments you like, just remember that we will be looking through the code and want to get a good understanding of your skills.

We know you are under a time limit and we will of course take this into account. It's perfectly fine to cut corners and focus on certain parts.

## How to deliver your code

- We prefer that you use git even though you shouldn't make your code public, that way we can track progress and the way you work
- Push to a private repository or zip up the code + .git folder
- Send it to your contact person as a link to a hosted location or if the zip is small enough, attach it.
